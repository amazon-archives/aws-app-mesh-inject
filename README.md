# App Mesh Inject

The AWS App Mesh Kubernetes sidecar injecting Admission Controller.

## Security disclosures

If you think you’ve found a potential security issue, please do not post it in the Issues.  Instead, please follow the instructions [here](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/) or [email AWS security directly](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).

## Installation
Please reference the [install instructions](INSTALL.md).

### Warning
To align our helm repository and this repository we have changed the namespace to appmesh-system and resource names to appmesh-inject. 

## Under the hood
### Enable Sidecar injection

To enable sidecar injection for a namespace, you need to label the namespace with `appmesh.k8s.aws/sidecarInjectorWebhook=enabled`

```
kubectl label namespace appmesh-demo appmesh.k8s.aws/sidecarInjectorWebhook=enabled
```

### Default behavior and how to override

For namespaces with sidecar injection enabled, pods will be injected if the `appmesh.k8s.aws/sidecarInjectorWebhook` annotation is `enabled` and will not be injected if it is `disabled`.
For pods with no annotation, they will be injected if the `-inject-default=true` flag is passed (the default for this flag) and will not be injected if the `-inject-default=false` flag is passed.

All container ports defined in the pod spec will be passed to sidecars as application ports.
To override, add `appmesh.k8s.aws/ports: "<ports>"` annotation to the pod spec.

By default all egress traffic ports will be routed, except SSH.
To override, add `appmesh.k8s.aws/egressIgnoredPorts: "<ports>"` annotation to the pod spec. ( Comma separated list of ports for which egress traffic will be ignored )

The name of the controller that creates the pod will be used as virtual node name and pass over to the sidecar. For example, if a pod
is created by a deployment, the virtual node name will be `<deployment name>-<namespace>`.
To override, add `appmesh.k8s.aws/virtualNode: <virtual node name>` annotation to the pod spec.

The mesh name provided at install time can be overridden with the `appmesh.k8s.aws/mesh: <mesh name>` annotation at POD spec level.

For example:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    name: my-cool-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: appmesh-inject
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        appmesh.k8s.aws/mesh: my-mesh
        appmesh.k8s.aws/ports: "8079,8080"
        appmesh.k8s.aws/egressIgnoredPorts: "22"
        appmesh.k8s.aws/virtualNode: my-app
        appmesh.k8s.aws/sidecarInjectorWebhook: disabled
```

To see an example on how to use this sidecar injector you can visit the [demo page](https://github.com/aws/aws-app-mesh-examples/tree/master/examples/). 

## Troubleshooting

### CA bundle not configured properly

If the CA bundle isn't configured properly, the pod will log the following log message:

```
TLS handshake error from 10.0.0.1:45390: remote error: tls: bad certificate
```

If this happens, set the `CA_BUNDLE` environment variable to the content of the CA bundle. Make sure that this value is base64 encoded (e.g. it shouldn't start with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`).
